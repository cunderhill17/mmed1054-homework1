![alt text](images/trafalgar_square.jpg "Crystal at Trafalgar Square")

Hi! My name’s Crystal. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;I grew up in the London area, though I’ve lived in more than a dozen places between *Port Burwell, Ontario*, and *Tweed, Ontario*. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a degree in English Literature from Western University and enjoy writing books in my spare time. 

## My Hobbies

&nbsp;&nbsp;I spend most of my time: 

* Watching movies or television 
* Writing 
* Travelling 
* Or trying new things with code 

&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently developing a mobile app for writers which aims to better organize the writing process for those who like to write on the go.

&nbsp;&nbsp;My Favourite Television and Movie Genres Are: 

* Stand-Up Comedy
* Rom-Coms
* Sports movies where the underdog comes out on top

&nbsp;&nbsp;My perfect day would be roaming through the streets of New York City or London, England, though the next place I’d like to travel to is Seoul, South Korea.
